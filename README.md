# Achievements
A showcase project for school, written in collaboration with [@qqavon](https://github.com/qqavon).
It's an app build for the teachers to add achievements to the subject they're teaching. Then they assing students to that subject.
The point is to make it easier for the students to know, what they *know* and what they *need to know*.
